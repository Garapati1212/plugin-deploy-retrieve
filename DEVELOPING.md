## One-time Setup

1.  Install NodeJS. If you need to work with multiple versions of Node, you
    might consider using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). </br>_Suggestion: use the current [LTS version of node](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)._
1.  Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage node dependencies. </br>_Suggestion: install yarn globally using `npm install --global yarn`_
1.  Clone this repository from git. E.g., (ssh): </br>`git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-deploy-retrieve.git`
1.  Configure [git commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

## Quick Start

1.  `cd` into the `plugin-deploy-retrieve` directory
1.  Checkout the main branch: `git checkout main`
1.  Get all latest changes: `git pull`
1.  Download NPM dependencies: `yarn install`. If it's been a while since you last did this you may want to run `yarn clean-all` before this step.
1.  Build and lint the code: `yarn build`
1.  Create a branch off main for new work: `git checkout -b <branch_name>` _Suggestion: use branch_name format of initials/work-title_. For external contributors, please fork the main branch of the repo instead and PR the fork to the main branch.
1.  Make code changes and build: `yarn build`
1.  Run changed commands: `./bin/dev.js project:deploy:start --help`
1.  Write tests and run: `yarn test` (unit) and/or `yarn test:nuts` (NUTs)
1.  Show all changed files: `git status`
1.  Add all files to staging: `git add .`
1.  Commit staged files with helpful commit message: `git commit`
1.  Push commit(s) to remote: `git push -u origin <branch_name>`
1.  Create a pull request (PR) using the GitHub UI [here](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-deploy-retrieve).

## Testing

All changes must have associated tests. This plugin uses a combination of unit testing and NUTs (non-unit tests).

### Unit tests

Unit tests are run with `yarn test` and use the mocha test framework. Tests are located in the test directory and are named with the pattern, `<test-file>.test.ts`. E.g., [start.test.ts](test/commands/deploy/start.test.ts). Reference the existing unit tests when writing and testing code changes.

### NUTs (non-unit tests)

Non-unit tests are run with `yarn test:nuts` and use the [cli-plugin-testkit](https://github.com/salesforcecli/cli-plugins-testkit) framework. These tests run using the default devhub in your environment. NUTs are a way to test the library code in a real environment versus a unit test environment where many things are stubbed.

## Debugging

If you need to debug plugin code or tests you should refer to the excellent documentation on this topic in the [Plugin Developer Guide](https://github.com/salesforcecli/cli/wiki/Debug-Your-Plugin).

## Linking any library into this plugin

When you want to use a local branch of a dependency, you'll need to link them together, to do so, follow these instructions:

1.  With the library changes built (e.g., `yarn build`), link the library by running `yarn link`.
1.  `cd` back to `plugin-deploy-retrieve` and run `yarn clean-all`.
1.  Download NPM dependencies: `yarn install`.
1.  Use the linked SDR library: `yarn link "@salesforce/source-deploy-retrieve"`. (this command will be printed after running the `yarn link` command from step 1)
1.  Build and lint the code: `yarn build`. If you get TypeScript module conflict errors during this step, see section below on TypeScript module conflicts.

## TypeScript Module Conflicts

During TypeScript compilation, you may see errors such as:

`error TS2322: Type 'import(".../plugin-deploy-retrieve/node_modules/@salesforce/core/lib/org/connection").Connection' is not assignable to type 'import(".../source-deploy-retrieve/node_modules/@salesforce/core/lib/org/connection").Connection'.`

This means the `Connection` interface in the core library used by the **plugin-deploy-retrieve** is different from the `Connection` interface in the core library used by the **source-deploy-retrieve library**, most likely because the core library dependencies are different versions.

To fix this we need to tell the TypeScript compiler to use 1 version of that library. To do this, temporarily modify the [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) file with the following lines inside the `compilerOptions` section and recompile:

```json
"baseUrl": ".",
"paths": {
    "@salesforce/core": ["node_modules/@salesforce/core"]
}
```

If there are conflict errors in the tests then we need to make a similar modification to the [test/tsconfig.json](test/tsconfig.json) file. Note that the `baseUrl` property for this modification points to the directory above:

```json
"baseUrl": "..",
"paths": {
    "@salesforce/core": ["node_modules/@salesforce/core"]
}
```

**_Note that these are temporary changes for linked compilation and should not be committed._**

## Running Commands

To run your modified plugin commands locally, use `./bin/dev.js` or `./bin/dev.cmd` file, which uses ts-node to execute the plugin's TypeScript commands.

```bash
# Run using local dev file.
./bin/dev project deploy start --help
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local scripts. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sf cli
sf plugins:link .
# To verify
sf plugins
# To run
sf project deploy start --help
```

## Useful yarn commands

#### `yarn install`

This downloads all NPM dependencies into the node_modules directory.

#### `yarn compile`

This compiles the typescript to javascript.

#### `yarn lint`

This lints all the typescript using eslint.

#### `yarn build`

This compiles and lints all the typescript (e.g., `yarn compile && yarn lint`).

#### `yarn clean`

This cleans all generated files and directories. Run `yarn clean-all` to also clean up the node_module directories.

#### `yarn test`

This runs unit tests (mocha) for the project using ts-node.

#### `yarn test:nuts`

This runs NUTs (non-unit tests) for the project using ts-node.
